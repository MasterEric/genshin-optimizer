  "substat-efficiency": "<0>What is substat efficiency?</0><p>Substat efficiency is a measurement of how high a substat is rolled, as a percentage between the lowest roll and highest roll. Say if a stat can roll 10 ~ 20, then 10 would be 0% efficiency, 20 would be 100%, 15 would be 50%, and so on...</p><p>Substat efficiency does not take into effect what type of substat it is measuring against, so ATK% would NOT be weighted more vs. flat ATK.</p>",
